# Autoencoders and the Fashion MNIST Dataset

This repository contains a notebook that demonstrates various uses of autoencoders on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The goal is to explore encoding and decoding techniques, as well as leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for enhanced performance. 

## Key Topics:
1. **Simple Clothing Reconstruction**:
   - Implementing a basic autoencoder to reconstruct the shapes of clothing items from the Fashion MNIST dataset.
   
2. **Noise Suppression with CNN Autoencoders**:
   - Using a convolutional autoencoder to remove noise from images, showcasing how these models can improve image quality through denoising.

3. **Deeper CNN Architectures**:
   - Building a deeper convolutional neural network (CNN) autoencoder to improve image reconstruction accuracy and capture finer details of the Fashion MNIST dataset.

4. **Data Augmentation**:
   - Applying data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization and performance by artificially expanding the dataset.
